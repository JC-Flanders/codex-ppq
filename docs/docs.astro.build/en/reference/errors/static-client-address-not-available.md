# Astro.clientAddress is not available in prerendered pages.

> **StaticClientAddressNotAvailable**: `Astro.clientAddress` is only available on pages that are server-rendered.

## What went wrong?

[](#what-went-wrong)

The `Astro.clientAddress` property is only available when [Server-side rendering](/en/guides/on-demand-rendering/) is enabled.

To get the user’s IP address in static mode, different APIs such as [Ipify](https://www.ipify.org/) can be used in a [Client-side script](/en/guides/client-side-scripts/) or it may be possible to get the user’s IP using a serverless function hosted on your hosting provider.
